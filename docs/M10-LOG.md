# M10 log — the error-propagation MVP

Narrative record; the plan is `docs/M10-PLAN.md`, the design record
`docs/ERROR-DESIGN.md` (E1–E11, ratified #110). Convention as in
the other programs: seam entries at pipeline seams, unit entries at
merges, the tail is the live state.

## Opening state (2026-08-29)

Opened on Evan's direction ("you'll be doing M10, error
propagation"), by a fresh orchestrator on a remote container. The
plan is a DRAFT design conversation — nothing dispatches until Evan
ratifies it; this entry records the operational facts that hold
either way.

**Operational facts, recorded once:**

- **Branch prefix (the #396 convention): `m10/`** — unit branches
  `m10/<unit>-<slug>`, orchestrator branch `m10/orchestrator`
  (Evan authorized the prefix at opening; the harness-designated
  session branch `claude/m10-error-propagation-q3e7i8` is unused).
- **A/B ordinal band: M10 = 500–599**, claimed in
  `docs/MODEL-AB-LOG.md`'s banding entry in the same commit that
  opens this program, per that entry's rule. Implementer blocks are
  named `M10-B1, M10-B2, …` (the GUI precedent — `M10-<n>` are
  unit names).
- **This session runs in a remote container** (the GUI program's
  precedent, adapted for a smaller disk): no persistent
  `~/.local/share/cad-work`, no script monitors (PR watching via
  MCP subscriptions + scheduled self check-ins; away-channel
  etiquette followed by hand under the `(M10 orchestrator)` tag),
  GitHub through MCP rather than `gh`. Disk ~29 G free is the
  binding constraint: lanes are worktrees sharing one object
  store, own `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` each, ≤ ~2 concurrent lane targets,
  review targets reclaimed at report time (Evan, at opening:
  subagents share fewer repo copies than the local-machine
  workflow assumes; the orchestrator checkout carries no target of
  its own). The build-slot mutex, per-lane target rule,
  CONFLICTING-means-silent-CI, and push-early rules bind unchanged.
  The clone arrived SHALLOW; unshallowed with a blob filter at
  opening (ancestry checks and merges misbehave on shallow
  history — a successor in this environment should check
  `git rev-parse --is-shallow-repository` before trusting either).

**Sweep at opening** (what the plan's slate is grounded in, beyond
ERROR-DESIGN itself): #687 (`ContentBits for Dual` — the memo-seed
design question, the one lock left on `evaluate::<Dual64>`), #701
(`Enclosure` ungated in the bounds allowlist), the D1 ruling and
its hedge collected in DESIGN.md's roadmap entry, #1055 (shell's
curved wall-clearance window, aimed at M10's certificate),
CONTACT-DESIGN C5 (the gap-measure contract), PARAM-LINT-SPEC PL6
(independence semantics; DISCIPLINES' unit, not ours), PERF-PLAN's
M10 rows, and the codebase survey recorded in the plan's substrate
section (headline finding: the W2 sketch solver was never built,
so E8's solver walls are vacuous in v1 — plan Q1).

## Ratification (2026-08-29)

Evan ruled all five plan questions in-conversation the same day:
Q1 solver OUT, Q2 mass-prop Measures banked, Q3 MC lane rides
M10-6, Q4 clean breaks, Q5 the #1055 arm in M10-5 as a STRETCH
("possibly ambitious" — the follow-up-unit valve is the answer to
that hedge). Rulings folded, STATUS flipped, #1142 merged. Two
cross-orchestrator registrations landed on the plan PR before
ratification and are folded in the plan text: VERBS's consumer
demand for the clearance certificate (fixtures in-tree), and
PCURVE's measured poison-vs-widen datum, whose CLASS M10-D owns
(PCURVE files the class issue; the instance's mechanism stays
with P-1b).

**Next dispatches**: M10-D (orchestrator-led design pass, its own
design-conversation PR) and the M10-1 spec + block M10-B1 draw run
concurrently — M10-1 does not depend on M10-D.
