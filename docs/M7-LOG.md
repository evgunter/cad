# M7 log — orchestrator record

Concurrent-orchestrator arrangement (Evan, 2026-08-04): this log
belongs to the M7 orchestrator (session cad-implement-m7); the M6
orchestrator's live record is docs/M6-LOG.md (read, don't touch).
Protocol: memories/concurrent-orchestrators.md; briefing:
~/.local/share/cad-work/handoff-prompt-m7.md.

## Session start (2026-08-04)

Checklist done: origin/main merged; monitors installed from this
checkout and armed (away-channel with
CAD_SIGNOFF_WATCHLIST=…/signoff-watchlist-m7.txt, disk watchdog,
hourly check-in); CPU canary 1.03s (healthy); disk 96G free;
cargo-slots.txt verified — slot 2 = cad-implement-m7, free; slot 1
= cad-implement-m6 (ev/ci-test-collapse, now PR #179).

**Plan + spec PR (#180)**: docs/M7-PLAN.md assembled from #169 +
D7 + #161 §2 (nothing newly proposed — self-merges per the
standing rule) plus the binding docs/M7-1-SPEC.md and this log.
Feasibility verified before speccing: topo's Euler-operator
vocabulary and geometry-attachment doors are public (step-export's
own test corpus builds bodies through them from outside topo), so
`crates/step-import` needs no kernel edits; hosted CI's
`--workspace`/closure scoping picks up a new member with zero CI
edits; the fixtures' declared uncertainty is 1e-9 and units are
metres (`.expect` volumes are mm³ — ×1e-9).

**A/B, block M7-1**: difficulty for M7-1 (import crate skeleton +
own-corpus round-trip) logged **L** BEFORE the draw — new crate
with a Part-21 parser, an Euler-op assembly algorithm over the
full entity subset (incl. composed_die's 89 faces, 42 reversed),
D7 adoption, and a six-row acceptance suite. Draw recorded below
after the difficulty line was committed in this file's history.
