//! Aggregated integration-test binary for `step-export`.
//!
//! Every `tests/*.rs` suite is included here VERBATIM via `#[path]`, so
//! this one binary stands in for one test target per suite.
//! The suite count is deliberately NOT restated in prose here:
//! `every_suite_file_is_aggregated` below checks this file against the
//! directory on every run, and a number written out beside it is a
//! second, unchecked copy of a set the compiler already knows.
//!
//! The files themselves are untouched: each keeps its own `//!` docs, its inner
//! attributes (`#![cfg(feature = "interval")]` and friends work as
//! module-level attributes), and its own `mod <helper>;` lines — a
//! `#[path]` module's child modules resolve against the DIRECTORY
//! CONTAINING the path file, i.e. `tests/`, exactly as when each file was
//! its own crate root.
//!
//! WHY: on the CI runner (2 vCPU) each extra test binary cost ~1.9 s of
//! codegen+link — measured at 494 of the 514 s of the workspace build job
//! (see the LINK/DEBUGINFO note in .github/workflows/ci.yml). The suites
//! are small; the per-binary constant was the bill.
//!
//! ADDING A SUITE: drop the file in `tests/` AND add a `#[path]` line
//! below. `autotests = false` in Cargo.toml means a file that is not
//! listed here does not compile and does not run — `every_suite_file_is_
//! aggregated` below fails loudly if you forget.
//!
//! Test IDs gain a module prefix (`export::round_trip` rather than
//! `round_trip`, under binary `all` rather than binary `export`); the set
//! of tests is otherwise identical.

// Each suite keeps its own verbatim `mod <helper>;`, so a shared helper is
// loaded once per suite that uses it. That is deliberate — the alternative
// is editing the suites — and it is what `duplicate_mod` is warning about.
// Allowed HERE ONLY, by name: no blanket `#![allow]`, which would weaken
// the lint gate for every suite module included below.
