//! **Rule G and the decision read, per PREDICATE** — the acceptance

//! while one predicate trades theorems for axioms and another gains
//! more than it lost reads as "nothing moved"; these rows read the
//! predicates.
//!
//! The pad is not here. Its shape report exhausts memory on the boxes
//! this suite runs on (DECIDE-1 measured it), so the pad is held per
//! document by `m10_9_pins_interval` and on the ceiling instrument,
//! and that is a gap this row states rather than hides.
