//! Aggregated integration-test binary for `profile`.
//!
//! Every `tests/*.rs` suite is included here VERBATIM via `#[path]`, so
//! this one binary stands in for one test target per suite.
//! The suite count is deliberately NOT restated in prose here:
//! `every_suite_file_is_aggregated` below checks this file against the
//! directory on every run, and a number written out beside it is a
//! second, unchecked copy of a set the compiler already knows.
//!
//! Each suite keeps its own `//!` docs and its inner attributes
//! (`#![cfg(feature = "interval")]` and friends work as module-level
//! attributes). What it does NOT keep is a `mod <helper>;` line of its
//! own: the shared helper trees are declared once, below, as modules of
//! THIS root, and a suite that wants one says `use crate::<helper>;`.
//! One declaration means one parse, one resolve, one type-check and one
//! codegen of that helper per binary instead of one per including suite.
//!
//! What that gives up: a suite file is no longer compilable as its own
//! crate root, because `crate::` now names this binary. Nothing in the
//! tree compiles them that way — `autotests = false` plus the guard below
//! make this file the only root — but it was true before and is not now.
//!
//! WHY ONE BINARY: on the CI runner (2 vCPU) the per-binary codegen+link
//! constant dominated the workspace build job — the suites are small, so
//! that constant was the bill. The figures are deliberately NOT restated
//! here: they were measured once, nothing in the repo re-takes them, and
//! the LINK/DEBUGINFO note in .github/workflows/ci.yml is the one place
//! that carries them with their date, their provenance run and the record
//! of what has since changed.
//!
//! ADDING A SUITE: drop the file in `tests/` AND add a `#[path]` line
//! below. `autotests = false` in Cargo.toml means a file that is not
//! listed here does not compile and does not run — `every_suite_file_is_
//! aggregated` below fails loudly if you forget.
//!
//! Test IDs gain a module prefix (`export::round_trip` rather than
//! `round_trip`, under binary `all` rather than binary `export`); the set
//! of tests is otherwise identical.

// The shared helper trees, declared ONCE for the whole binary. This file
// is the crate root, so a plain `mod` resolves against `tests/` —
// `tests/common/mod.rs` — and every consumer
// reaches that one instance through `use crate::<helper>;`.
//
// NO `#[path]` ON THESE, deliberately: a path attribute in this file is
// the aggregation guard's census of SUITE files
// (`every_suite_file_is_aggregated` counts them against the directory
// walk), and a helper module directory is not a suite. `mod` without the
// attribute is also what `test_utils::source::suite_files` assumes when
// it skips a directory carrying a `mod.rs`.
//
// There is no `#![allow(clippy::duplicate_mod)]` here because no file is
// loaded twice any more; if one ever is, the lint is meant to fire.
