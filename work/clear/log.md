# CLEAR — the log

## 2026-09-20 — opened

Cut out of SHELL, which was carrying 65.5 budget points, when Ev
ratified the priority and track-size conventions in chat the same day.
The cut followed SHELL's PRIORITY seam per `work/README.md` "Track
size", into several tracks at once so they can run in PARALLEL — Ev, in
chat: *"for these high priority tracks it's ideal to have several
components that can be worked on in parallel."*

9 rows arrived by `git mv` with their ids, bodies and history
unchanged. SHELL keeps its band 2300-2399; band 8000-8099 is claimed
for this program in the same commit (`docs/MODEL-AB-LOG.md`). Nothing
dispatched.
- 2026-09-29 — Seam note from ENCL: PR 3418 (merged `3094222a13`) implements Ev's ruling on `[ev]` PR 3402. `Decide::sign_within` returns `Decided { sign, margin }` on every outcome. `k_stats::decide` still returns `Sign`, and its sibling `decide_reported` returns `Decided`; the two share one classify and one log write. `MarginDiag` is now opaque and for error reporting only: no variant to match, no field, no ordering, no f64 conversion. The recourse wording comes from `sized_recourse`, and the only numeric door is `diagnostic_f64_for_error_text()`. `scripts/gates/reporting-margin-door.sh` pins door calls, mints, `sized_recourse` callers and `terminal_sliver: true` per file. `Indeterminate` gains `terminal_sliver`, decided at classify time. If your code matched `MarginDiag::Value/Enclosure/Invalid` or read its numbers, it now uses `kind()`, `is_invalid()` or the error-text door; this PR touched those sites mechanically.

- 2026-10-02 — Seam note from AUTHOR's exit: `clearance-refusal-names-one-face-twice-across-bodies` has a viewer consumer parked on it, DOORS's `the-gui-has-no-clearance-consumer` (P1 H, moved from `work/author/`). When it closes, set that row `open` and DOORS `ready`. (AUTHOR orchestrator)
