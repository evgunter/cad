# SSI — the log

Cut out of CHART, which was carrying 105 budget points, when Ev
ratified the priority and track-size conventions in chat the same day.
The cut followed CHART's PRIORITY seam per `work/README.md` "Track
size", into several tracks at once so they can run in PARALLEL — Ev, in
chat: *"for these high priority tracks it's ideal to have several
components that can be worked on in parallel."*

7 rows arrived by `git mv` with their ids, bodies and history
unchanged. CHART keeps its band 6200-6299; band 7500-7599 is claimed
for this program in the same commit (`docs/MODEL-AB-LOG.md`). Nothing
dispatched.

- 2026-09-28 — Seam note from ENCL: PR 3348 (merged `95b59b9361`) homes the domain-uniform refinement grid in `geom_core::spline::algebra::domain_grid_points(kv, pieces, GridSkip)`. `GridSkip` is `BitEqual` or `WithinUlps(u32)`, and `pub const SLIVER_CLEARANCE_ULPS` replaces `quad.rs`'s private `SLIVER_CUT_ULPS`. It is used at `props/quad.rs` `refine_dir` and `bezier_blocks`, `ssi/certify.rs` `refined`, `edge_nurbs.rs` `localized::breaks`, and one tcost/tint test. Bits are unchanged at every site (pinning rows added first). Each caller still chooses its own skip guard and control-count cut-off, so the NURBS hairline fix is now a one-argument change at each site. (ENCL orchestrator)
- 2026-09-28 — Seam note from ENCL: PR 3351 (merged `e39a5c4cc4`) routes certification refusals per D4 ¶1 as Ev ruled on PR 3352. Recourse belongs to the decision (`CertCheck::ending()`, one table) and the reading belongs to the door: `geom_brep::certify::recourse(check, RefusedArm, Reading::{Build, AtRest, Adopt})`. `CertifyError`/`PlaneNurbsRefusal` `Display` is now payload-only. Each door appends `ending(reading)`. The `certification: ` prefix is gone. `work/ssi/plane-nurbs-certificate-escalation-does-not-name-its-limb.md` is filed on your slate (`SsiError::Escalated` carries no limb; the poisoned transversality aggregate reaches the last resort).

- 2026-09-28 — Seam note from ENCL: PR 3382 (merged `9bf495c768`) adds `geom_brep::recourse`, the one table for sized decisions. `Reading`/`RefusedArm` moved there from `certify`, alongside `SizedPass`, `SizedDecision` and `Classified`. certify and the offset meters both route through it. The shared unreadable-margin note now reads "an unreadable or collapsed margin may indicate a kernel bug worth reporting". Filed on your slate: `work/ssi/ssi-transversality-death-says-lower-the-tolerance.md`. (ENCL orchestrator)
