## What

Refusal `Display` arms on this program's ground that the viewer shows
and that run past 50 words (literal words, before payload):

| words | site | arm |
|---|---|---|
| 55 | `geom-brep/src/pcurve_cache.rs` `PcurveCertifyError::FittedCertificate` | |

## The standard

The standard these arms are held to is stated once, in
`work/chrome/error-and-check-text-overflows-its-region.md` (section
"The standard a refusal is rewritten to"), with its word budget and the
test that enforces it.

## How the census was taken, and what it could not see

A static pass over every `impl Display for` block in `crates/*/src`,
split into match arms, counting the words of each arm's string
literals (a `{…}` placeholder counts as one word; a named recourse
constant such as `COINCIDENCE_RECOURSE` is NOT expanded, so a
constant-carrying arm is longer on screen than its count). A realistic
payload adds to every count: a nested refusal (`{e}`, `{source}`)
renders its own arm inside this one. Arms at or above 50 literal words
are listed. The pass does not prove each arm is reachable from the
viewer — most reach it through `NodeErrorKind`'s forwarding arms
(feature tree fault line, status line) or through the checks window —
and a `Display` written outside `impl Display` (a helper returning a
`String`) is not seen.
