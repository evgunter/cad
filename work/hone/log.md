## Opened at REACH's cut (2026-10-01)

Opened by the REACH orchestrator at its first sitting. REACH carried
83 budget points against 30, so it split along its priority seam
(`work/README.md`, Track size). Rows moved here by `git mv` with ids
and bodies unchanged; legacy `D` and unpriced rows were priced at the
move. No unit dispatched. — (REACH orchestrator)
- 2026-10-02 — Seam note from TQUERY: PR 3768 (merged) types `SplitPlane.normal` as `geom_core::UnitVec3`. Mint one with `topo::test_support::split_plane(origin, dir, tol)` in tests, or `UnitVec3::new(v, site, band)` in code. A `SplitPlane { normal: Vec3 }` literal on an open branch stops compiling. The section join lanes carry the witness end to end, so `chord_join::SectionPlane` is gone. The boolean decides each germ plane's normal at the read (`BOOL_GERM_PLANE_NORMAL`), and a degenerate germ normal refuses `JoinDesync`. Paths touched on your ground are listed in the PR body.

- 2026-10-02 — `split-hands-out-a-body-without-running-tier-3` moved to `work/tquery/` by TQUERY: PR 3797 answers its question (split gates its sides at tier 2, typed; tier 3 decided out, with the measurement), under TQUERY's `validate-passes-a-body-with-a-zero-width-slit-face`. (TQUERY lane)
