title: Main's slow set is red on two rows since PR 4553 (knot algebra off the ring): the sweep serial-golden digest and the arc-loft import volume bits

Two rows of the slow set (the nightly's; CI's per-PR `ci` profile
filters them out) fail on main since PR 4553's merge (98e620a195,
`nurbs/knot-algebra-off-the-ring`). INTENT's stage 3 A lane reported
that both pass on its parent. The INTENT orchestrator reproduced both
failures on main at 80fa908950 with
`cargo nextest run -p sweep -p step-import -E 'test(the_walk_matches_the_serial_golden_at_four_threads) | test(arc_loft_natively_computes_its_rational_volume)'`:
2 run, 2 failed.

- `sweep::all mass_props_are_thread_count_invariant::the_walk_matches_the_serial_golden_at_four_threads`:
  the serial-golden digest moved
  (`crates/sweep/tests/mass_props_are_thread_count_invariant.rs:471`,
  `check_against_golden`).
- `step-import::all nurbs_import::arc_loft_natively_computes_its_rational_volume`:
  the imported solid's certified volume is no longer bit-identical to
  the native one (`crates/step-import/tests/nurbs_import.rs:373`).
  The row pins bit identity on purpose (R1 MINOR-2), so the reader's
  reconstruction and the native build now run different quadrature
  bits. That is a finding, not a re-pin, until the divergence is
  explained.

Owed: root-cause both against 4553's change. If a digest moved for a
stated reason, re-baseline it and say what moved. If the bits now
differ because the two sides compute the knots differently, make them
compute them the same way.
