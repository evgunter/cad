# VIEW log

Newest entries at the bottom; the tail is the program's live status.
Plan: `work/view/plan.md`. A/B band 1900–1999
(`docs/MODEL-AB-LOG.md` owns every live experiment number).

## Opening state (2026-09-03)

Opened on Ev's direction (in-chat, 2026-09-03: "proceed to actually
creating these tracks with their own directories in work/") from the
2026-09 work-track proposal, `docs/WORK-TRACKS-2026-09.md`, whose VIEW section is the
charter this plan restates. Opens after CHROME's slate. Items re-homed into this
directory at opening, by header edit and `git mv` only (ids unchanged):

- `viewer-session-god-module-split` from `work/issues/`
- `pick-priority-filter-vocabulary` from `work/issues/`
- `camera-fold-clears-status-line` from `work/issues/`
- `focus-marking-is-per-node-not-per-segment` from `work/issues/`
- `pick-index-built-on-ui-thread` from `work/issues/`

No unit is cut and no branch exists yet. The first dispatch claims its
ordinal from the band above and records it in `docs/MODEL-AB-LOG.md`.

## Hand-off from DOCM (2026-09-04)

`layer3-recipenodeid-aliases-across-rewinds` re-homed here by
header-preserving `git mv`: the rule is ratified
(`docs/DOCM-IDENTITY-DESIGN.md` DI1 — a held id is valid on the history
branch that minted it; tools clear on history replacement), the build
is the viewer's. Signed (DOCM orchestrator).

## Unit 1 ratified and merging; 1b dispatched (2026-09-04)

Ev signed off on the boundary rule and the sequencing on #1801, the
`Refusal` question is answered above, CI green on the head carrying the
correction. `needs_ev` cleared; the item goes `dispatched` on 1b's
branch.

**1b is out**, `view/1b-gesture-as-data`, style review to follow per
this program's posture. Its brief carries the three constraints the
evidence forced — change no operation's current answer (including
`Save`'s), do not let one predicate read as a guarantee over two
unrelated gestures, and derive the guarded/unguarded split from the
tree rather than from the dispatch. That last one is deliberate: the
list in the brief is the orchestrator's reading, and
`docs/prompts/reviewer-style-lane.md` is explicit that a dispatch is a
hypothesis. A lane correcting it is the lane working.

**On Ev's "have subagents split up the monster files".** Yes, and the
bound worth being concrete about is that **parallelism here is per
FILE, not per module**: six lanes each extracting one module from
`session.rs` would spend their time resolving merge conflicts on one
file. So 1c is two lanes — one for `session.rs`, one for `app.rs`,
which are independent — each doing its whole file's extraction, after
1b lands and shrinks the session lane's job by 23 guards.
