# WIRE log

Newest entries at the bottom; the tail is the program's live status.
Plan: `work/wire/plan.md`.

## Opened (2026-09-11)

Opened in the tracker cut of 2026-09-11 (Ev's direction, in-chat;
`docs/WORK-TRACKS-2026-09.md` addendum 3). This is the successor
`docs/DOC-LEDGER.md` sweep 9 anticipated when EVAL closed on 2026-09-08:
its residue table put three rows in `work/issues/` naming two more
already there and called the five "the successor's opening slate". All
five are here.

Thirteen rows moved in by `git mv`, each with a `## Re-homed` record:
nine from `work/issues/`, four from `work/code-quality/` (`S40`, `S195`,
`D364`, and `profile-has-no-scalar-lift-door`).

No branch exists yet; the first dispatch is the E block, and
`contact-class-has-two-content-tag-functions` looks like a
verify-and-close against the tree as it is now.

## Orchestrator opened, E block dispatched (2026-09-11)

Posture set by Ev in-chat at the opening: **light style reviews on every
unit, full reviews on the units with a real risk of being wrong, and no
A/B protocol.** `plan.md` §Review posture records which units are which
and why, and the band 3700–3799 stays claimed for bookkeeping with no
ordinal drawn from it — which is what `docs/MODEL-AB-LOG.md` already says
about the eleven programs of this cut.

**Closed without a unit: `contact-class-has-two-content-tag-functions`.**
The cut's "appears already discharged" reading held at `8851abb`.
`contact_class_tag` is not in the tree; all three `eval/mod.rs` key sites
feed `ContactClass::content_tag`; and the third site the finding named —
the interface-crossing feed — is
`persist/kernel_wire/contact_class.rs`, a **string** vocabulary anchored
on `ContactClass::ALL` with a refusal arm for a class a newer kernel
adds. One enum, two exhaustive projections over `ALL`, different change
rates: not the twin the finding reported. Citations in the item's
`## Closed`.

**`S40` split, three of its four bullets re-homed.** It was one file
carrying four unrelated residues on three programs' territory, and WIRE
owns one. Filed straight onto the owners' slates per `work/README.md`
("when the owning program is clear, file the item straight onto that
program's slate"): the NaN-as-`throw` idiom and `Rim`'s two direction
fields to **PROPS** (`crates/geom-brep/src/props/*` is its glob), the one
`HashSet` to **SHELL** (`crates/topo/src/transform.rs` is its file — and
the row is re-read as a conformance to D9 rather than a call about it,
since the crate doc already names `SecondaryMap` as the preferred form).
`S40` keeps its id and bullet 1.

**And bullet 1's premise is stale, which is the finding of the sweep.**
`WitnessSlot {}` and `NodeErrorKind::WitnessBifurcation` are deliberate
forward declarations — both say so at the site — reserved for *"the M6
solver"*. `docs/DESIGN.md`'s roadmap records M6 **complete**, as the SSI
generic-`T` lift plus loft/sweep assembly plus composition surgery, with
no witness solver in it, and says the sketch solver *"re-opens as its own
design pass when constraint-driven sketches have a consumer."* So the
reservation is real and its citation is wrong: reviewer-style-lane Q4,
a premise invalidated by the thing it cites. `S40` is now `deferred`
against that roadmap sentence rather than `open`; the two-line re-citation
rides the next PR touching `eval/mod.rs`. Deleting the stubs is NOT
decided here.

**`D364` is a subset of `S195`.** `S195` names `ProgramTarget`/`WireTarget`
as one of its "three smaller pairs" and that is `D364`'s vocabulary at the
same `res_spec`/`res_target` hop. They are one sequence: `D364` first as
the prototype census, `S195` generalising it. Recorded in `plan.md`
§Order.

**`D385`'s pointer corrected** on `profile-embed-lift-has-two-homes`:
it is `work/tint/D385.md` now, moved at S-TINT's opening. The fence
consequence is recorded on the item — WIRE mints the door in
`crates/profile/src/`, S-TINT's `D385` converts the two test copies
afterwards, and `D385`'s list today names one of those two. Announce to
S-BOOL and S-TINT at dispatch.

**Dispatched, three lanes, one PR each** (E block, light style review
each):

| lane | branch | row |
| --- | --- | --- |
| wire-e1 | `wire/placement-affine-map` | `placement-lifts-its-affine-by-hand-beside-affine3-map` |
| wire-e2 | `wire/family-consts` | `wire-expected-phrases-spell-family-words-as-literals` |
| wire-e3 | `wire/names-refusal-carries-cause` | `names-flush-and-select-discard-a-refusal-with-map-err-underscore` |

wire-e3's brief carries a class the item did not: `names/discriminate.rs:18`
does the same `map_err(|_| …)` over `Band::linear`, one enum over, so the
sweep is over the shape and not the two named lines.

Held for Ev, and why each is a fork rather than a sequencing call:
`axis-flavoured-declarations-have-no-channel` (the item's own
`[ev]` shape — a placement-level declaration against a frame-level
identity that survives placement), and `product-gather-…`'s stated rule
for a tie spanning one root's output bodies, where the recommendation is
to carry the tie.
