Filed by the CLEAVE orchestrator (2026-10-03). Both designers on the
mints fork (`topo-mints-indeterminates-outside-the-funnel`) raised it.

D9's "a state that can only be a kernel bug MUST panic … downgrading one
to a typed error launders a bug into a supported outcome" (`a0781edfa`)
and row 4 of its taxonomy ("observable in a branch → `unreachable!`") sit
beside typed errors for bug-only states:
`BooleanError::ClassificationInvariant` (PR 4's skeleton, `305c8b1f1`,
which predates the restatement), `VolumeCorrupt` and similar, all ending
in `KERNEL_DEFECT_ENDING`. Mint site I2 ("the declared ladder returned
`Distinct`") is one of them.

`JoinDesync` is reachable by API misuse under the open S14 ruling, so a
typed error is right there.

`decide_invariant`'s "Corrupt-class typed error, never a panic" (#213,
`2d44ce70d`) covers integral-result backstops, whose firing is evidence
of a bug rather than a state that can only be one. That reading has not
been reconciled with D9 anywhere.

Owed: classify each variant in the family against the D2 addendum's rows,
then either panic or say why the state is reachable. PR 2928's body
claims "`unreachable!` (denied here)", but `Cargo.toml` has
`panic = "warn"` and `unreachable!` sits outside that family; correct the
claim wherever it is repeated.
