## Cut from PROPS (2026-09-20)

Ev, in chat: PROPS' slate had reached 66 open rows, and the question
put back was whether to cut new programs for the logical chunks and
leave in PROPS only what that orchestrator would finish itself. Ev:
*"that sounds like a good plan!"* This program is one of three cut
that day (QUAD, ENCL, FRAME). No orchestrator is seated yet — the
items, the charter and the lanes are here so that seating one is the
only remaining act.

The cut deliberately does NOT contort the territory globs to keep the
at-rest overlap check quiet. Ev, same conversation: *"it's ok if units
have shared ground, they should just be aware of each other if working
at the same time"* — so the `keep_out` above records the real
relationships rather than a partition, and the awareness mechanism is
the per-branch territory check plus the announced-seam convention.

- 2026-09-28 — Seam note from ENCL: PR 3348 (merged `95b59b9361`) homes the domain-uniform refinement grid in `geom_core::spline::algebra::domain_grid_points(kv, pieces, GridSkip)`. `GridSkip` is `BitEqual` or `WithinUlps(u32)`, and `pub const SLIVER_CLEARANCE_ULPS` replaces `quad.rs`'s private `SLIVER_CUT_ULPS`. It is used at `props/quad.rs` `refine_dir` and `bezier_blocks`, `ssi/certify.rs` `refined`, `edge_nurbs.rs` `localized::breaks`, and one tcost/tint test. Bits are unchanged at every site (pinning rows added first). Each caller still chooses its own skip guard and control-count cut-off, so the NURBS hairline fix is now a one-argument change at each site. (ENCL orchestrator)
- 2026-09-29 — Seam note from ENCL: PR 3418 (merged `3094222a13`) implements Ev's ruling on `[ev]` PR 3402. `Decide::sign_within` returns `Decided { sign, margin }` on every outcome. `k_stats::decide` still returns `Sign`, and its sibling `decide_reported` returns `Decided`; the two share one classify and one log write. `MarginDiag` is now opaque and for error reporting only: no variant to match, no field, no ordering, no f64 conversion. The recourse wording comes from `sized_recourse`, and the only numeric door is `diagnostic_f64_for_error_text()`. `scripts/gates/reporting-margin-door.sh` pins door calls, mints, `sized_recourse` callers and `terminal_sliver: true` per file. `Indeterminate` gains `terminal_sliver`, decided at classify time. If your code matched `MarginDiag::Value/Enclosure/Invalid` or read its numbers, it now uses `kind()`, `is_invalid()` or the error-text door; this PR touched those sites mechanically.

- 2026-10-02 — New P0 row from SHOW: `check-7-refuses-the-reporting-budget-on-a-definite-sign` (PR 3838, the lily's lanceolate blades). Check 7's sign walk is cut off by the round-0 `last_round_refuses` exit against the REPORTING target, so a loft or cubic sweep of an arc section is refused tier 3 at the default ε — a regression of the refusal TCOST-K3 retired. Same exit in all three patch lanes `sign_walk` reaches. (SHOW lane, lily-lanceolate)
