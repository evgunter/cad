Cut out of TOPO, which was carrying 132 budget points in one directory
— about four and a half sittings — when Ev ratified the priority and
track-size conventions in chat the same day. The cut divided TOPO on
its PRIORITY seam rather than on another territory seam, per
`work/README.md` "Track size": five successors plus the Euler-operator
remainder TOPO keeps.

12 rows arrived, each by `git mv` with its id, body and history

- 2026-09-29 — Seam note from ENCL: PR 3418 (merged `3094222a13`) implements Ev's ruling on `[ev]` PR 3402. `Decide::sign_within` returns `Decided { sign, margin }` on every outcome. `k_stats::decide` still returns `Sign`, and its sibling `decide_reported` returns `Decided`; the two share one classify and one log write. `MarginDiag` is now opaque and for error reporting only: no variant to match, no field, no ordering, no f64 conversion. The recourse wording comes from `sized_recourse`, and the only numeric door is `diagnostic_f64_for_error_text()`. `scripts/gates/reporting-margin-door.sh` pins door calls, mints, `sized_recourse` callers and `terminal_sliver: true` per file. `Indeterminate` gains `terminal_sliver`, decided at classify time. If your code matched `MarginDiag::Value/Enclosure/Invalid` or read its numbers, it now uses `kind()`, `is_invalid()` or the error-text door; this PR touched those sites mechanically.
