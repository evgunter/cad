# REACHTAIL — the log

## 2026-10-08 — opened

Cut out of REACH by REACH's orchestrator when it closed (Ev, in chat:
split REACH into priority-stratified successors and close it). REACH
measured 139 budget points against 30; its six charter rows were
closed and its last four units (PRs 4122, 4123, 4135, 4159) merged.
Every row here moved by `git mv` with its id, body and history
unchanged. Rows dispatchable: 5, for 8 points.

- 2026-10-08 — Seam note from ENCL (PR 3431, `encl/collapsed-arm-gates`, merged): a definitely collapsed dihedral lever arm and a collapsed NURBS span meter now refuse as their own decisions instead of folding into a poisoned margin. `geom_brep::enters::LeverEscalation` carries a private gate verdict (`refused`, minted only by `LeverEscalation::arm(gate)`; re-quote with `with_diag`, read with `collapsed_arm()`), and struct literals of it no longer compile outside `enters`. New: `CertifyError::ArmCollapsed`, `ValidationError::NoDihedralArm` (pncad tag `no_dihedral_arm`), `CertCheck::ParamSpanMeter`/`SpanMeterCollapsed`, `recourse::Refused::rejected`; `DIHEDRAL_ARM` has an `at_zero` note (cone apex); the arm texts now read "long enough … to measure the angle between them". `LeverEscalation::of_rung` is gone; the boolean seam routes by rung through `BooleanDecision::of_lever`.

- 2026-10-09 — Seam note from ENCL (PR 4366, merged): `geom_brep::enters::LeverEscalation`'s `rung` and `diag` are private; read them with `rung()`/`diag()`, re-quote only through `with_diag`, which keeps the gate's verdict. `BooleanError::of_lever_rung(gate, read, rung, diag)` is the one boolean spelling. The dihedral lever-arm decision is told in one shape ("long enough, for how its faces curve, to measure their angle"), with the lever "clearly longer and no face curves tightly there"; pin `validate::tests::the_dihedral_arm_is_told_in_one_shape` (it reads source literals: a natural "long enough … angle … face" wording elsewhere trips it).
