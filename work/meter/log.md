# METER log

Newest entries at the bottom; the tail is the program's live status.
Plan: `work/meter/plan.md`.

## Opened (2026-09-06)

Opened in the tracker-wide cut of 2026-09-06 (Ev's direction,
in-chat; `docs/WORK-TRACKS-2026-09.md` addendum 2), with GATES, the
two halves of code-quality Track K claimed whole. Eleven rows moved
by `git mv` with a `## Claimed by` record each: eight with `track: K`
and three unlettered rows on K's `tools/*` fence. `S115`(a) (the inert
`agree` column) and `S29` (the sizing policy) stay in
`work/code-quality/` — the first as a member of a roll-up this
program will take as a rider on unit 1 if the roll-up is not split
first, the second as S-MESH's design PR. No branch exists yet; the
first dispatch is unit 1.

## Orchestrator seated; review posture set; slate re-read (2026-09-07)

Ev seated an orchestrator on this program in chat and set its review
posture in the same breath: **no A/B protocol** — most units are easy —
**a style review each, and a full falsification review only for the
units that are genuinely tricky.** `plan.md`'s *Review posture* now
carries that, with the two units that qualify named and the reason each
qualifies stated: `D206` and `k-report-baseline-fold-cert1-roster`, both
because they move committed measurements other lanes read. The A/B band
3200–3299 stays claimed for bookkeeping and no row will be written to
`docs/MODEL-AB-LOG.md` from this program.

The slate was read end to end against the tree before the first
dispatch, and three things came back that the tracker did not know.

**The join item's fix has landed and the item does not know it.**
`tools/tess-lint/src/lib.rs`'s `Kind::Rekeyed` / `Rekey` under
`compare`'s rule-4 precondition closes both branches
`tess-lint-face-ordinal-join` names. `plan.md`'s step 8 still described
that tripwire as unlanded, under the name `Kind::Reordered` it was
proposed with; the sentence is corrected and the item becomes **unit
0**, because reading it as open mis-states what `C15` has left to do.
The unit is not pure bookkeeping: `compare`'s `gated` split routes a
re-key on a scene with no Hessian-sized face to `notes` rather than
`findings`, which is #738's `diefillet` exactly, so the permutation the
item was written around is reported in the lint's quietest voice and
nobody has recorded whether that is right.

**The stale-doc item's own table has gone stale.** Re-derived against
the baseline as committed today (cut `aba2625f8f84`, 2026-09-04, later
than the `a4eb03a` the item read): 1353 rows, 1,552,822 triangles, the
64 NURBS faces at 4.7% carrying 10.6%. The item said 1306 / 1,416,410 /
4.9% / 11.6%. That is the item's own mechanism firing on the item, four
days after it was filed, and it settles both open questions in the
file — the block is stale against re-cuts rather than describing an
older sweep, and the fix is to CITE `tess-lint`'s report header, never
to commit a fourth transcription. Recorded on the item.

**A pin cannot close `k-lint`'s roster in the direction that matters.**
`k-lint-predicate-roster-unpinned` reaches for `D204`'s `include_str!`
remedy, which worked there because `CHART_TAGS` and `Chart::tag` are
the same finite set. `EPS_COUPLED_PREDICATES` is a SUBSET selected from
an open vocabulary by a property that is written down nowhere, so a pin
closes the RENAMED direction and cannot close the ADDED one at all.
Filed as `k-lint-eps-coupled-criterion-unwritten` so the pinning lane
is dispatched knowing it, rather than discovering at review that its
claim is narrower than the item it cites.

Dispatch order from here: unit 0 and unit 1 both sit in
`tools/tess-lint/src/lib.rs` and are sequenced rather than run
together; unit 2 is disjoint (`docs/TESS-BUDGET.md`) and runs beside
whichever of them is live. `D201` goes out as an `[ev]` PR early rather
than at step 8 — it is the slate's one design fork and its long pole,
and the answer wants to be in hand before the cheap end is exhausted.
