# BAND — the log

## 2026-09-20 — opened

Cut out of CARVE, which was carrying 73 budget points, when Ev
ratified the priority and track-size conventions in chat the same day.
The cut followed CARVE's PRIORITY seam per `work/README.md` "Track
size", into several tracks at once so they can run in PARALLEL — Ev, in
chat: *"for these high priority tracks it's ideal to have several
components that can be worked on in parallel."*

9 rows arrived by `git mv` with their ids, bodies and history
unchanged. CARVE keeps its band 5600-5699; band 7800-7899 is claimed
for this program in the same commit (`docs/MODEL-AB-LOG.md`). Nothing
dispatched.

## Announced seam from TOPO (2026-09-24)

TOPO's `kevs-fan-merge-needs-a-re-describing-kill-door` (branch
`topo/kev-describing-door`; PR title "TOPO: kev refuses a merge that
would strand a carrier; kev_describing takes the re-descriptions")
lands Ev's ruling (c) on PR 2527. `Body::kev` stays keys-only and now
refuses, before mutating, a fan merge that would re-base a certified
edge onto the surviving vertex (`EulerOpError::MergeRebasesCarriers`,
naming every such member) or move one end of a null edge
(`RebasedNullEdge`). It carries a merge that moves nothing: an empty
fan, or a killed null edge. `Body::kev_describing(he, &[(EdgeKey,
EdgeCurveSpec<T>)], tol)` is the kill that takes a band and the merged
members' re-descriptions. A listed member is certified at the merged
endpoints. An unlisted one passes the re-basing gate `mev`'s fan site
passes. `kev_describing(he, &[], tol)` is the kill with a band and
nothing re-described.

**Your files, and what changed in them.**

- `crates/sweep/src/blend/surgery.rs` (BAND's and CARVE's): the two
  closure kills take `kev_describing`. `rim_phase`'s is
  `"rim closure kev"` and `rim_phase_annulus`'s crossing kill is
  `"annulus closure kev"`; the refusal site names are unchanged. Each
  hands its one merged member the band's meridian arc under arc
  scaffolding (`EdgeCurveSpec::arc_of_circle`), using the centre and
  radius the description pass already reads for the slit. That member
  is the upper meridian remnant, or the mate seam's rim-side piece.
  The final pass still states the slit as the band's seam through
  `attach_contact`. `attach_contact`'s arc construction moved into
  `short_arc`, which the new `merged_meridian_spec` shares. Without
  this change these were 118 of the 129 sweep refusals S93 measured.
  At the head, `cargo test -p sweep --lib --test all` shows 1501
  passed and 8 ignored, as on the merge base.
