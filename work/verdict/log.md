# VERDICT — the log

## 2026-09-20 — opened

Cut out of PROPS, which was carrying 108.5 budget points, when Ev
ratified the priority and track-size conventions in chat the same day.
The cut followed PROPS's PRIORITY seam per `work/README.md` "Track
size", into several tracks at once so they can run in PARALLEL — Ev, in
chat: *"for these high priority tracks it's ideal to have several
components that can be worked on in parallel."*

13 rows arrived by `git mv` with their ids, bodies and history
unchanged. PROPS keeps its band 2400-2499; band 9500-9599 is claimed
for this program in the same commit (`docs/MODEL-AB-LOG.md`). Nothing
dispatched.

- 2026-09-28 — Seam note from ENCL: PR 3343 (merged `f5390b0605`) adds `geom_core::k_stats::splice_superseded`, which splices a detached run's verdicts and samples without its escalations. The tangency certificate uses it, so a renamed refusal no longer leaves a second-order escalation on the node's log. `editor-core`'s `drive.rs` factors read (2) into `log_read` with the same behaviour. `geom-brep/tests/m5_pr9_tangent.rs` gains three rows. On a sliver-shaped box, a renamed or definite tangency refusal now bisects to the floor and is priced Budget; the evidence is appended to VERDICT's `coincidence-zone-priced-budget-at-the-floor`.

- 2026-09-29 — Seam note from ENCL: PR 3418 (merged `3094222a13`) implements Ev's ruling on `[ev]` PR 3402. `Decide::sign_within` returns `Decided { sign, margin }` on every outcome. `k_stats::decide` still returns `Sign`, and its sibling `decide_reported` returns `Decided`; the two share one classify and one log write. `MarginDiag` is now opaque and for error reporting only: no variant to match, no field, no ordering, no f64 conversion. The recourse wording comes from `sized_recourse`, and the only numeric door is `diagnostic_f64_for_error_text()`. `scripts/gates/reporting-margin-door.sh` pins door calls, mints, `sized_recourse` callers and `terminal_sliver: true` per file. `Indeterminate` gains `terminal_sliver`, decided at classify time. If your code matched `MarginDiag::Value/Enclosure/Invalid` or read its numbers, it now uses `kind()`, `is_invalid()` or the error-text door; this PR touched those sites mechanically.
